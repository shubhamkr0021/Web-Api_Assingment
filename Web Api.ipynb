    "Ans)  Advantages of Using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    ". Functionality Extension: APIs allow developers to access functionalities or services provided by other applications or systems, enabling them to enhance their own applications without building everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Time and Cost Efficiency: Leveraging APIs saves development time and resources by utilizing existing, tested functionalities rather than developing them internally.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Improved Integration: APIs facilitate seamless integration between different systems, enabling data exchange and interoperability among applications.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Enhanced User Experience: By integrating with APIs, applications can offer a broader range of features and services, improving the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Innovation and Flexibility: APIs encourage innovation by enabling developers to build upon existing technologies and create new, innovative applications by combining functionalities from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    ". Dependency on Third-Party Services: Reliance on external APIs makes applications vulnerable to changes or disruptions in the third-party service, impacting functionality if the API experiences downtime or changes in its terms.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Security and Privacy Risks: Integrating external APIs introduces potential security vulnerabilities and data privacy risks if the API isn't properly secured or if sensitive information is exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Limited Control: Developers have limited control over the functionality, performance, and updates of third-party APIs, potentially causing challenges if the API doesn't meet specific requirements or undergoes changes.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Versioning and Compatibility Issues: APIs may undergo updates or version changes, leading to compatibility issues if the newer version differs significantly from the previous one, requiring adjustments in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Performance Impact: External APIs can impact an application's performance, especially if the API response times are slow or unreliable, affecting the user experience."
